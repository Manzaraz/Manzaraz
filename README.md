## My Passion for Mobile Development with Swift

Hello everyone! I'm a full-stack developer passionate about technology, music, and coffee. I live in Tucumán, Argentina, and I'm also a big cat lover.
A few years ago, my curiosity to learn something new led me to explore the world of web development and programming with JavaScript. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work with various databases, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB, using libraries like Sequelize, Express, and Node.js. However, my true passion has recently been ignited in mobile development, specifically with the Swift language.

## My Journey in Mobile Development with Swift:

My curiosity and enthusiasm for mobile development have led me to delve deeper into learning Swift, Apple's primary language for creating applications for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS. I've had the chance to explore the UIKit and SwiftUI frameworks, and I'm very proud of my progress in data management using technologies like Core Data, SwiftData, and integrating them with services like Firebase.
I'm excited to be able to bring my development skills to new environments, such as iOS, VisionOS, macOS, and watchOS. Each day, I'm more amazed as I learn something new in this language and see how I can transform my ideas into functional and attractive applications.

Seeking Collaboration in an Agile Environment Now, I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate in a work environment where I can put into practice what I've learned about agile methodologies, SCRUM, and best development practices. I'm excited about the idea of working in a team, learning from my colleagues, and contributing to the achievement of objectives.
Thank you for visiting my profile! I hope to be able to share more of my passion for mobile development with Swift in the future.
